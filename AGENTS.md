## Identity

This repo is **sarvam-cast** — part of the [sovereign-shovels](../README.md) portfolio.

- **Substrate anchor:** Sarvam
- **Utility category:** cast
- **Tagline:** Subscribe to RSS, get a daily Hindi/Tamil/Telugu podcast. Bulbul TTS + LLM summary. Fully sovereign.
- **Sprint:** deferred (most speculative; validate demand before commit)
- **Estimated build for v0.1:** 2–3 weeks for v0.1

The substrate this shovel rides is: Indian commute / vernacular news consumers, content creators auto-generating podcasts

The launch channels are: Indian podcast Twitter, LinkedIn India creator economy, r/India, vernacular content forums

## Philosophy this repo lives by

Read the universal philosophy: [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]].

In short, every shovel must satisfy all five rules:

1. **Substrate-anchored name** ✓ (this is `sarvam-cast`)
2. **Sovereign by construction** — user owns model choice, BYO endpoint, must work with local-only
3. **Real demand evidence** — gap is documented, not assumed
4. **Buildable in 1–3 weeks** — v0.1 estimate is 2–3 weeks for v0.1
5. **Scope-evolution headroom** — see PRD-v1 for v0.1 → v0.5 → v1.0

## STRICT NO-NOS — do not violate any of these

### Universal (inherited from [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]])

1. NO hardcoded API keys, vendor URLs, or model names in code outside config files.
2. NO default that requires a sign-up upstream. Tool must work with a local model.
3. NO telemetry, phone-home, or analytics by default.
4. NO closed-source runtime dependencies that compromise sovereignty.
5. NO scope creep into "agent platform" or "general assistant" territory.
6. NO fake claims of being official upstream tooling.
7. NO breaking config changes in v0.x without printed migration path.
8. NO maintenance promises in README. "Best-effort community shovel."
9. NO PRs merged without working tests.
10. NO publishing v1.0 without PRD-v1 acceptance criteria met.

### Specific to sarvam-cast

1. Never store RSS content beyond the duration needed to generate the audio.
2. Audio output must include attribution to source articles.
3. Default to user-controlled cron schedule, not always-on.

### Anti-scope (what NOT to build, ever, in this repo)

Not a full podcast hosting platform. Not a content discovery tool. Not a news aggregator beyond user-supplied RSS.

## How to operate here

When you (the agent) start work in this repo:

1. **Read** [[PRD-v1]] before writing any code.
2. **Read** [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]] and [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]] if you haven't this session.
3. **Update** [[progress]] after each significant change. Update the YAML
   frontmatter — the root [[../PORTFOLIO]] view aggregates from it.
4. **If a decision conflicts with this AGENTS.md**, STOP and ask the human.
5. **If a user asks for something that violates a no-no**, push back. Don't comply.
6. **Commits** follow conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
7. **Branches**: `main` is protected. Work on `feat/<thing>` branches and PR.
8. **Tests** are required for any code path that ships in v0.1.

## Tombstone watch

What could kill this shovel:

Spotify or Apple shipping AI-generated podcasts in Indic. Possible but Indic isn't priority. Medium probability over 12 months.

What we're watching for:

Spotify ships personalized AI briefings for India.

If the kill signal triggers, notify the human before taking further action.
