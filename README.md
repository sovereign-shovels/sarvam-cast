## What this is

Subscribe to RSS, get a daily Hindi/Tamil/Telugu podcast. Bulbul TTS + LLM summary.

## What this isn't

See [PRD-v1.md](./PRD-v1.md) for the full anti-scope definition.

## Install

### From package manager (when v0.1 ships)

```bash
npm install -g sarvam-cast
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sovereign-shovels/sarvam-cast.git
cd sarvam-cast
```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Or link for local dev
npm link
```

## Configure

You bring the model. By default `sarvam-cast` tries to use a local provider:

- For LLM endpoints: Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`
- For voice endpoints: configurable, see docs

To use any other provider (Claude, GPT, Hermes, OpenRouter, Sarvam, etc.):

```toml
# ~/.config/sarvam-cast/config.toml
[provider]
endpoint = "https://api.your-provider.com/v1"
api_key_env = "YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY"
model = "your-model-name"
```

Anthropic, OpenAI, and Sarvam endpoints all work. Local Ollama, llama.cpp,
LM Studio, and vLLM all work via their OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Why this exists

See [PRD-v1.md](./PRD-v1.md) for the problem statement and rationale.

## What's next

See [PRD-v1.md](./PRD-v1.md) for the full v0.1 → v0.5 → v1.0 plan.
